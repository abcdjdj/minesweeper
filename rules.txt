1. The board is a two-dimensional space, which has a predetermined number of mines. 
2. Cells have two states, opened and closed. 
3. If you left-click on a closed cell: 
      1. Cell is empty and opened.
            1. If neighbor cell(s) have mine(s), this opened cell shows neighbor mine count. 
            2. If neighbor cells have no mines, all neighbor cells are opened automatically (recursively).
      2. Cell has a mine, game ends with FAIL. 
4. If you right-click on a closed cell, you put a flag which shows that "I know this cell has a mine".  
   Right clicking on a flagged cell again will remove the flag.
5. If all cells (without mines) are opened using left clicks and all mines are marked with a flag, game ends with SUCCESS.
